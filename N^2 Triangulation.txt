Pick the left most and bottom most point. Say it is v, neighbors are u and w.

Either u-w is a diagonal.
Otherwise there are some points inside uvw triangle. Take the point which is furthest most from uw.
Also consider if there is any point on the uw segment.

Partition into two polygons. And solve it recursively.
